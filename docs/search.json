This then allows us to view the outside factors that might have been impacting depression levels in 2013. If prozac suppression usage is high, then in the year 2013 depression levels were high as well especially in black and brown communities because they are the majority of medicaid users.\nThere are both categorical and quantitative variables, the categorical consist of the type of drug, suppression usage(true or false), and states. The quantitative is package sizes, year and quarters."

    "text": "Literature\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459223/\nThis article goes into the depth the impact of Prozac in various situations as well as why Prozac is used and for what kinds of patients. It outlines the FDA approved portions of the drug and the parts that are left to therapist and mental health specialist. Furthermore, it gives details of the adverse effects and symptoms of the drug. What this article does more than any others is gives advice for enhancing healthcare team outcomes and places preganant women and children at the forefront because children as young as 8 can use Prozac.\nMy research question builds on and is different from the article because its focus on the usage of prozac in different states in a particular year and allows space to dive into the political and social sphere of that specific year. Rather the article is more generalized and not specific to state usage numbers, medicaid and one particular year. ## Glimpse of data\n\n\nprozac_utilization <- read_csv(\"data/data.csv\")\n\nRows: 498 Columns: 15\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (6): utilization_type, state, ndc, labeler_code, package_size, product_name\ndbl (8): product_code, year, quarter, units_reimbursed, number_of_prescripti...\nlgl (1): suppression_used\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nglimpse(prozac_utilization)\n\nRows: 498\nColumns: 15\n$ utilization_type               <chr> \"FFSU\", \"FFSU\", \"MCOU\", \"MCOU\", \"MCOU\",…\n$ state                          <chr> \"FL\", \"FL\", \"FL\", \"FL\", \"FL\", \"FL\", \"FL…\n$ ndc                            <chr> \"00777310402\", \"00777310502\", \"00777310…\n$ labeler_code                   <chr> \"00777\", \"00777\", \"00777\", \"00777\", \"00…\n$ product_code                   <dbl> 3104, 3105, 3105, 3105, 3107, 3104, 310…\n$ package_size                   <chr> \"02\", \"02\", \"02\", \"30\", \"30\", \"02\", \"02…\n$ year                           <dbl> 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 2013, 201…\n$ quarter                        <dbl> 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, …\n$ suppression_used               <lgl> TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRU…\n$ product_name                   <chr> \"PROZAC\", \"PROZAC\", \"PROZAC\", \"PROZAC\",…\n$ units_reimbursed               <dbl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,…\n$ number_of_prescriptions        <dbl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,…\n$ total_amount_reimbursed        <dbl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,…\n$ medicaid_amount_reimbursed     <dbl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,…\n$ non_medicaid_amount_reimbursed <dbl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,…"

The data ranges from 2002 to 2018.\nFrom the data, we can see that every state in the United States is accounted for each year. The different drugs recorded in the data set are alcohol, tobacco, cocaine, and marijuana as well as an age range for each of them. There are 3 age ranges from 12-17, 18-25, and 26+. Also, there are totals and rates for each of the drugs that are recorded in the data set."

The data came form the Justice Department, who collected jail death.\n\nWrite a brief description of the observations.\n\nThe majority of the inmates who died were never convicted of charges.\nOver 80% of the deaths in the jails were of male inmates."

    "text": "Research question\n\nA well formulated research question. (You may include more than one research question if you want to receive feedback on different ideas for your project.

Also, it was reported that the Justice Department at one point “recorded only 39 percent of deaths in local jails,” demonstrating how the terrible conditions and the severity of the issue becomes hidden, which makes it harder for policymakers and activists to become aware or speak out about these issues. Especially when about 2/3 of the inmates who die are not convicted, it makes the situation worse that the jails don’t have human decency or provide basic needs for inmates.\n\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\n\nThe research question goes more into details of different jails or states and how race and gender is represented in the deaths in the data."

    "text": "Introduction and Data\nHow has the rate of marijuana and tobacco use changed from 2013 to 2018 in 18-25 year olds in North Carolina (where marijuana is illegal) and Colorado (where marijuana was legalized in 2013), and is there a significant difference between the change in marijuana and tobacco use in the two states? Given the recent increase in legalization of cannabis (Forbes) and the increase in tobacco prevention education (Tobacco Free Kids) in the past several decades, we were interested to see if marijuana usage has been increasing and tobacco usage has been decreasing among 18-25 year olds (which is our age range) from 2013 to 2018.\nOur dataset contains alcohol, cigarette, cocaine, marijuana, and tobacco use statistics for all 50 states and the District of Columbia from 2002 - 2018, broken down into three age ranges: 12-17, 18-25, and 26+. The data comes from CORGIS: The Collection of Really Great, Interesting, Situated Datasets, and was originally stored in the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Data Archive (SAMHDA). The data was gathered from the annual National Survey on Drug Use and Health. There are 53  variables, including state, year, and usage (totals and rates) of various drugs for each age group. The dataset includes 867 total observations.\nAs mentioned earlier, we chose to focus on Colorado because marijuana was legalized there and North Carolina because that’s where we are. Therefore, we filtered the dataset for just those two states. In addition, since we are investigating marijuana and tobacco usage among 18-25 year olds we selected just marijuana usage rates and tobacco usage rates for 18-25 year olds among all the drug use data that was included. Finally, several variables were renamed and a new variable “years since legalization” was created to represent the number of years that had passed since marijuana legalization in Colorado in 2013.  \nIt is important to consider the ethical concerns and biases that may be present in the collection of this data. Since our data comes from a voluntary response sample, it may not be entirely accurate because people can choose to not respond or to respond inaccurately, especially when regarding a topic such as drug use that has legal implications. \n\n\nRows: 867 Columns: 53\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (1): State\ndbl (52): Year, Population.12-17, Population.18-25, Population.26+, Totals.A...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiterature Review\nA study done from 2008 - 2016 investigated whether increases in recreational marijuana legalization led to any changes in marijuana use and cannabis use disorder. The study also used data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, and looked at the states of Colorado, Washington, Alaska, and Oregon because of their recent recreational marijuana legalization and compared them to other “control” states where recreational marjuana has not been legalized. To examine if there were differences in marijuana usage after its legalization, the authors looked at the three age ranges of 12-17 years old, 18-25 years old, and 26+ years old and constructed logistic regression models that measured before vs after changes in variables such as self reported past month marijuana use, frequent marijuana use, and cannabis use disorder. They found that for 12-17 year olds, legalization of marijuana led to an increase in cannabis use disorder, and for 26+ year olds past month marijuana usage increased. However, for 18-25 year olds there were no significant increases in marijuana use or cannabis use disorder. This study is related to our research because it also looks at the effects of marijuana legalization. However, our study adds to this work by also examining whether marijuana legalization has any impact on tobacco usage as well. \nSource: Cerdá, Magdalena et al. “Association Between Recreational Marijuana Legalization in the United States and Changes in Marijuana Use and Cannabis Use Disorder From 2008 to 2016.” JAMA Psychiatry, vol. 77, no. 2, Nov. 2019, doi:10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.3254.\nMethodology\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nTo explore our research question, we conducted two hypothesis tests for a difference in the regression coefficients (the difference in the rate of change) of marijuana usage and tobacco usage in Colorado and North Carolina. To do this, we built two interaction models that examined the interaction effect that the state (CO or NO) and explanatory variable (years since legalization) had on the response variable (marijuana usage rate, tobacco usage rate. We then used the p-value of the interaction term given by the model in our hypothesis test.\nHypothesis Test for Marijuana\n\\(H_0:\\beta_{Col\\_mar} - \\beta_{NC\\_mar} = 0\\)\n\\(H_a:\\beta_{Col\\_mar} - \\beta_{NC\\_mar} > 0\\)\nNull hypothesis: There is no difference in the rate of increase in marijuana usage in Colorado and North Carolina between 2013-2018\nAlternative Hypothesis: The increase in marijuana usage in Colorado is greater than the increase in marijuana usage in North Carolina from 2013-2018\n\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 5\n  term                                estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  <chr>                                  <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)                          0.310     0.00653    47.5   4.27e-11\n2 yrs_since_legal                      0.00562   0.00216     2.61  3.13e- 2\n3 StateNorth Carolina                 -0.133     0.00924   -14.4   5.17e- 7\n4 yrs_since_legal:StateNorth Carolina -0.00110   0.00305    -0.362 7.27e- 1\n\n\nHypothesis Test for Tobacco:\n\\(H_0:\\beta_{Col\\_tob} - \\beta_{NC\\_tob} = 0\\)\n\\(H_a:\\beta_{Col\\_tob} - \\beta_{NC\\_tob} < 0\\)\nNull hypothesis: There is no difference in the rate of decrease in tobacco usage in Colorado and North Carolina from 2013-2018\nAlternative Hypothesis: The decrease in tobacco usage in Colorado is greater than the decrease in tobacco usage in North Carolina from 2013-2018\n\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 5\n  term                                estimate std.error statistic       p.value\n  <chr>                                  <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>         <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)                          0.320     0.0104     30.7   0.00000000139\n2 yrs_since_legal                     -0.0237    0.00345    -6.87  0.000128     \n3 StateNorth Carolina                 -0.0131    0.0148     -0.889 0.400        \n4 yrs_since_legal:StateNorth Carolina  0.00431   0.00488     0.884 0.402        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\nRegression Equations\nMarijuana usage in Colorado after legalization (2013 - 2018):\n\\(CO\\_marijuana\\_usage\\_rate = 0.3101 + 0.0056 * year\\)\nMarijuana usage in North Carolina 2013 - 2018:\n\\(NC\\_marijuana\\_usage\\_rate = 0.1768 + 0.0045 * year\\)\n\\(year\\) = number of years since marijuana legalization in Colorado (2013)\np-value of interaction between explanatory variable (year) and category (state: NC/CO): 0.73\nTobacco usage in Colorado after marijuana legalization (2013 - 2018):\n\\(CO\\_tobacco\\_usage\\_rate = 0.3201 - 0.0237 * year\\)\nTobacco usage in North Carolina 2013 - 2018:\n\\(NC\\_tobacco\\_usage\\_rate = 0.3070 - 0.0193 * year\\)\n\\(year\\) = number of years since marijuana legalization in Colorado (2013)\np-value of interaction between explanatory variable (year) and category (state: NC/CO): 0.4\nFor both of our hypothesis tests, the p-value of the interaction between our explanatory variable (the number of years since marijuana legalization in Colorado in 2013) and our category (the two states Colorado and North Carolina) was much higher than our chosen significance level of 0.05. Therefore, we failed to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the rate of increase in marijuana usage and the rate of decrease in tobacco usage between North Carolina and Colorado. \nDiscussion"
