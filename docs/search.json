This then allows us to view the outsidde factors that might have been impacting depression levels in 2013. If prozac suppression usage is high, then in the year 2013 depression levels were high as well especially in black and brown communities because they are the majority of medicaid users.\nThere are both categorical and quantitative variables, the categorical consist of the type of drug, suppression usage(true or false), and states. The quantitative is package sizes, year and quarters."

    "text": "Literature\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459223/\nThis article goes into the depth the impact of Prozac in various situations as well as why Prozac is used and for what kinds of patients. It outlines the FDA approved portions of the drug and the parts that are left to therapist and mental health specialist. Furthermore, it gives details of the adverse effects and symptoms of the drug. What this article does more than any others is gives advice for enhancing healthcare team outcomes and places preganant women and children at the forefront because children as young as 8 can use Prozac.\nMy research question builds on and is different from the article because its focus on the usage of prozac in different states in a particular year and allows space to dive into the political and social sphere of that specific year.
